  title: [A Comparison of Boson Sampling and Quantum Circuits in Interferometry],
  abstract: [
    Interferometers are devices which use light, or more generally superimposing waves, 
    using interference to extract information. We propose a method by which quantum 
    information, as well as non-linear interferometers can be modelled and simulated 
    with quantum circuits.
