  title: [A Comparison of Boson Sampling and Quantum Circuits in Interferometry],
  abstract: [
    Interferometers are devices which use light, or more generally superimposing waves, 
    using interference to extract information. We propose a method by which quantum 
    information can be obtained and used as a benchmark for quantum circuits,
    as well as modelling non-linear interferometers. We simulate these with traditional
    classical methods, then show quantum circuit variants, finally showing how these
    circuits can be used as benchmarks for qubit coherence.
